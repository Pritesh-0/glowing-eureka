# Inverse Kinematics Using ANN

The main problem in robotic control is to find a precise and reliable solution for the inverse
kinematics, which is necessary for real time control of the robotic arm. The calculation itself is
computational intensive and time consuming.
This project proposes an ANN based method to generate trajectories and inverse
kinematic solutions for manipulators only requiring the the forward kinematics.
